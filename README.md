# CSV Comparison Tool
- Allows the input of two csv files and will give the user the choice of which column should be compared between the two files.
- If a matching value is found, it will output the matches under a single column in the "out.csv" it generates

## Usage
1. Two input files are all that are required currently for this program to operate successfully.
2. The two example files will serve as an input to test, but should be replaced as only two files can be found in the project's current iteration
3. Build the binary, or run locally with `go run main.go` to run the process
4. Choose the output shown in the terminal for csv 1 and 2 based on the columns you intend to compare
5. Check the "out.csv" file for the matches and see the terminal for the number of matches found
